Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in an organization's IT infrastructure to reduce the overall risk of attacks. This process typically involves two main techniques: vulnerability assessments, which scan for possible vulnerabilities, and penetration testing, which simulates a real-world attack to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. While vulnerability assessments mainly involve automated scanning, penetration testing also includes manual testing by trained security professionals.
