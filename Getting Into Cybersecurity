How to start your way into cyber security:
 
 read this book: https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/CyBOK_v1.1.0.pdf

 Additionally:
1. Computer Basics  
2. Networking Basics
3. Windows and Linux 
4. Programming Languages  (e.g .python, java)
5. CTFs  (Capture the Flags) - ctftime.org

1)  Use tryhackme.com for learning concepts, tools and practicing at the same time. When you are confident use vulnhub.com. Then head over to hackthebox.eu
2)  If you want a job in cybersecurity most companies will require you to have some specific certification.  
3) Some good certifications are: 
CISSP: https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP
BLT1: https://securityblue.team/certifications/ 
OSCP: https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/ 
CEH and sec+ have a very bad reputation with cyber professionals as they are extremely easy to get or can even be bought for money. But some HR departments will still like it as they have no clue.
