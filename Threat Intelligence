Threat Hunt: Investigator - A handy recon tool!

Recon, short for reconnaissance, gathers information about a target or potential threat. It’s crucial for every offensive security practice, such as red team and pentest.

What for threat hunters?

As explained by MITRE ATT&CK, most of the recon activities are performed outside of the scope of our defenses and controls, so it’s not easy to prevent them!

A proactive and interactive Recon enables threat hunters to understand potential threats better so that blue teams make informed decisions and respond to threats more effectively.

The Investigator is a handy web-based recon tool that gathers third-party tools and google dorks to facilitate the recon process for us.

1. Password files
2. Directory Listing
3. Database related
4. Config and log files
5. Backup files
6. Find subdomains

The Investigator: https://lnkd.in/gJ6727sS

By analyzing the data collected during recon, threat hunters can proactively identify potential vulnerabilities, issues, misconfigurations, entry points, and even unknowns in a digital wonderland and anticipate the tactics and techniques attackers might use to exploit those weaknesses.

Ah, and the main threat, remember? Scope X: https://lnkd.in/dNu7UXXF
