What is SIEM?
Security Information and Event Management.
It is a security management solution that helps in collecting, parsing, and correlating events from various logs

Collecting:
 From many different resources across your entire IT infrastructure:
(AV, Firewall, IPS, IDS, Database, EndPoints Security, ….etc)

Parsing OR Normalization:
Is the process of converting unstructured data into a structured format
Examples:
Raw Log {Jan 1 20:28:02 knight sshd [20336]: Failed password for root from 218.49.183.17 port 49869 ssh2}
Parsing (Metadata)
Event: Failed Password
Username: root
Source IP: 218.49.183.17
Source Port: 49869
Protocol: ssh

Aggregation OR Analyzing:
• It is the process of merging similar logs that occur over a period of time.
Examples:
If there are 20 failed login events by a user on a server, the server would generate 20 logs. But, instead of storing all the 20 logs, SIEM will only store 1 record.

Correlation:
Correlation can be defined as a set of conditions that indicate suspicious activities.
Examples:
·       User activity during non-business hours
·       VPN logins from multiple locations
·       Multiple malware #malware on the same host

--> Does it work? Great! That is a mini SOC. Document it somewhere and link it to your resume.🙏

------> Additional steps: <------

- Increase log visibility (activate PowerShell logging, Scriptblock logging, install Sysmon, etc)

- Install extra tools to get more visibility e.g.: Bluespan, DeepBlueCLI, Suricata Zeek, RITA (all are on GitHub)

- Test your setting! Be a bad guy and try to catch yourself. (WinPwn, Atomic Red Team, Caldera -> again, check out GitHub)

- If needed improve your SIEM with matching alert rules and build Dashboards. (Ideas? Look at Sigma rules -> GitHub)

🎁 Elastic ELK SIEM:

🔰 ELK's architecture:
✔️ Elastic's ELK is an open-source stack for managing and analyzing large volumes of data.  The ELK stack consists of three applications (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana ).

✔️ Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database based on the Lucene search engine and built with RESTful APIs. It is essentially the index, store, and query application of the ELK stack.

✔️ Logstash is the tool responsible for the collection, transformation, and transport of log file records.

✔️ Kibana is the tool used for visualizing the Elasticsearch documents.

✔️ Beats is an additional download that should be installed in every remote location for its logs to be shipped to the Logstash component.

____________________________________________
🔰 Process of how data flows from Beats to Kibana in the Elastic ELK stack:
1. Data collection: Beats collects data from different sources, such as logs, metrics, or network packets, and sends them to Logstash or Elasticsearch directly.

2. Data processing: If the data is sent to Logstash, it goes through a series of filters where it can be parsed, Transformed, and Enriched before being sent to Elasticsearch. Logstash can also handle data enrichment, such as adding geo-location data or user agent information.

3. Data indexing: Elasticsearch then indexes the data, making it searchable and available for analysis.

4. Data visualization: Kibana is used to visualize and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can create custom dashboards, visualizations, and reports to gain insights into the data. Kibana also provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and filtering results, and using lucene query search to
