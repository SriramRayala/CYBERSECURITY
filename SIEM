🎁 Elastic ELK SIEM:

🔰 ELK's architecture:
✔️ Elastic's ELK is an open-source stack for managing and analyzing large volumes of data.  The ELK stack consists of three applications (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana ).

✔️ Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database based on the Lucene search engine and built with RESTful APIs. It is essentially the index, store, and query application of the ELK stack.

✔️ Logstash is the tool responsible for the collection, transformation, and transport of log file records.

✔️ Kibana is the tool used for visualizing the Elasticsearch documents.

✔️ Beats is an additional download that should be installed in every remote location for its logs to be shipped to the Logstash component.

🔰 Process of how data flows from Beats to Kibana in the Elastic ELK stack:
1. Data collection: Beats collects data from different sources, such as logs, metrics, or network packets, and sends them to Logstash or Elasticsearch directly.

2. Data processing: If the data is sent to Logstash, it goes through a series of filters where it can be parsed, Transformed, and Enriched before being sent to Elasticsearch. Logstash can also handle data enrichment, such as adding geo-location data or user agent information.

3. Data indexing: Elasticsearch then indexes the data, making it searchable and available for analysis.

4. Data visualization: Kibana is used to visualize and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can create custom dashboards, visualizations, and reports to gain insights into the data. Kibana also provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and filtering results, and using lucene query search to
